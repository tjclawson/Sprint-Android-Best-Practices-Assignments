Module 2: Android Crash Reporting

## Build a Crashing App and View Reporting

## Instructions:

1. Create an app and add Crashlytics
2. Create an Activity that includes 4 buttons
3. Each button will generate a different kind of crash
4. Add breadcrumbs to each button
5. Inspect the Crashlytics reports to see the crashes (issues)

## Stretch goals
1. Turn on ProGuard in your app
2. Use (this doc)[https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/get-deobfuscated-reports?platform=android] to deobfuscate your crashes
3. See that the crash logs in your Logcat are obfuscated, but the Crashlytics logs are deobfuscated
